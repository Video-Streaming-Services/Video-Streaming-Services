# Video-Streaming-Services

Hello there, you may think how to run our service for now, right?

Don't worry I have your back covered, just follow these instructions:

## First you have to install docker in your device

Here is the official documentation in how to do it. [link](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Now just copy the docker-compose file that we provided [here](docker-compose/docker-compose.yml) .

In the same directory of the docker-compose.yml just type the command 

```shell
docker compose up
```
And Enjoy the experience ðŸ˜‰

## And at the end to shut down the process 

just type the command 

```shell
docker compose down
```
